@cindex Introduction

GetDP (a General environment for the treatment of Discrete Problems) is
a scientific software environment for the numerical solution of
integro-differential equations, open to the coupling of physical
problems (electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, etc) as well as of
numerical methods (finite element method, integral methods, etc). It can
deal with such problems of various dimensions (1D, 2D or 3D) and time
states (static, transient or harmonic).

The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between its internal
structure (written in C), the organization of data defining discrete
problems (written by the user in ASCII data files) and the symbolic
mathematical expressions of these problems. Its aim is to be welcoming
and of easy use for both development and application levels: it consists
of a working environment in which the definition of any problem
makes use of a limited number of objects, which makes the environment
structured and concise. It therefore gives researchers advanced
developing tools and a large freedom in adding new functionalities.

The modeling tools provided by GetDP can be tackled at various levels of
complexity: this opens the software to a wide range of activities, such
as research, collaboration, education, training and industrial studies.

@c Research and Collaboration Activities
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Research, Education, Introduction, Introduction
@heading Research and Collaboration Activities

The internal structure of the software is very close to the structure
used to define discrete problems in the input data files. As a result, a
unicity and conciseness of both development and application levels is
obtained without any interface between these, which facilitates work of
any kind---particularly validations.  GetDP enables to rapidly develop
tools for the comparison of methods and the exchange of solutions
between research teams, which is one of the main aims of collaboration.
Moreover, after a short training, GetDP could be used by teams as a basis
to their own developments, while keeping a large freedom in these.

@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------
@c Education and Training Activities
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Education, Industry, Research, Introduction
@heading Education and Training Activities

The software environment consists of modeling tools applicable to
various physical problems. Education and training can therefore be
offered in various domains and at different levels.  The closeness
between the definition of discrete problems and their symbolic
mathematical expressions entails that the theory and mathematical bases
of numerical methods, which are essential to anyone who wants to tackle
the solving of discrete problems, can be directly followed by their
practical applications. These applications can be evolutive, in the
sense that the offered tools are of various levels of
complexity. Everyone can tackle, step by step, depending on his
apprenticeship level, tools adapted to the solving of more and more
complex problems, as well as various methods for the solving of the same
problem.

@c Industrial studies
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Industry, How to Read this Manual?, Education, Introduction

The treatment of industrial problems can also be facilitated because
GetDP is adapted to the study of a wide range of physical problems using
various numerical methods. In particular, adapted made-to-measure and
ready-to-use software could be rapidly developed for given problems.

@cindex Reading, guidelines

After reading @ref{General overview}, and @ref{Expressions}, which depict
the general concepts and the way to construct simple expressions in GetDP,
you can safely (in a first reading) skip @ref{Objects} and @ref{Types for
objects} and directly go to @ref{Short examples}. This chapter gives simple
examples of the problem definition syntax used to define the discrete
problems. For each example, you should then go back to @ref{Objects}, and
@ref{Types for objects}, and have a detailed view of the syntax of the
objects appearing in it. Note that indexes for many concepts and for all the
syntax elements are available at the end of this manual.

Once the examples presented in @ref{Short examples}, are understood, you
may start to use GetDP on your computer (@pxref{Running GetDP}), for
example by solving the complete examples presented in @ref{Complete
examples}. Ready-to-use input files for these examples can be downloaded
from the web site.

@cindex Philosophy, general
@cindex Processing cycle

An assembly of computational tools (or objects) in GetDP leads to a
problem definition structure, which is a transcription of the
mathematical expression of the problem, and forms a text data file: the
equations describing a phenomenon, written in a mathematical form
adapted to a chosen numerical method, directly constitute data for
GetDP. The following table summarizes the names of all GetDP objects (in
the first column), along with their respective dependencies (in the
second column):

@sp 1
@example
Group           @var{---}
Function        Group
Constraint      Group, Function, (Resolution)
FunctionSpace   Group, Constraint, (Formulation), (Resolution)
Jacobian        Group
Integration     @var{---}
Formulation     Group, Function, (Constraint), FunctionSpace,
                Jacobian, Integration
Resolution      Function, Formulation
PostProcessing  Group, Function, (Jacobian), (Integration), 
                Formulation, (Resolution)
PostOperation   PostProcessing
@end example
@sp 1

The resolution of a discrete problem with GetDP requires the definition,
in a text data file, of the objects listed in this table. The gathering
of all the objects constitutes the problem definition structure, which
is a copy of the formal mathematical formulation of the problem. Reading
the table from top to bottom pictures the working philosophy and the
chaining of operations peculiar to GetDP, from mesh generation to
results visualization.

The computational tools which are at the center of a problem definition
structure are formulations (@code{Formulation}) and function spaces
(@code{FunctionSpace}). Formulations define systems of equations that
have to be built and solved, while function spaces contain all the
quantities, i.e.@: functions, fields of vectors or covectors, known or
not, involved in formulations. 

Each object of a problem definition structure must be defined before being
referred to by others. A chaining which always respects this property is the
following: it first contains the objects defining particular data of a
problem, such as geometry, physical characteristics and boundary conditions
(i.e.@: @code{Group}, @code{Function} and @code{Constraint}) followed by
those defining a resolution method, such as unknowns, equations and related
objects (i.e.@: @code{Jacobian}, @code{Integration}, @code{FunctionSpace},
@code{Formulation}, @code{Resolution} and @code{PostProcessing}).  The
processing cycle ends with the presentation of the results (i.e.@: lists of
numbers in various formats), defined in @code{PostOperation} fields.  This
decomposition points out the possibility of building black boxes, containing
objects of the second group, adapted to treatments of defined problems.

All the preceding explanations can seem very (too) general.  Which are the
problems that GetDP can actually solve? To answer this question, here is a
list of methods that we have considered and coupled together until now:

@table @asis
@item Numerical methods
finite element method@*
boundary element method@*
volumic integral methods
@item Geometrical models
one-dimensional models (1D)@*
two-dimensional models (2D), plane and axisymmetric@*
three-dimensional models (3D)
@item Time states
static states@*
sinusoidal and harmonic states@*
transient states
@end table

These methods were successfully applied to build coupled physical models
including:

@table @asis
@item magnetic problems
magnetostatics@*
magnetodynamics@*
@item electric problems
electrostatics@*
electrokinetics@*
electrodynamics@*
@item electromagnetic wave problems
@item acoustic wave problems
@item lumped electric circuits
@item thermal problems
@end table

As can be guessed from the preceding list, GetDP has been initially
developed in the field of computational electromagnetics, which fully
uses all of the offered coupling features. We believe that this does not
interfere with the wished generality of the software because a
particular modeling forms a problem definition structure which is
totally external to the software: GetDP offers computational tools; the
user freely applies them to define and solve his problem. Problems and
methods that are under development include:

@table @asis
@item Physical models
mechanical problems (rigid body movement, elasticity)
@item Numerical methods
finite volume method@*
time domain finite difference method

Expressions are the basic tool of GetDP. They cover a wide range of
functional expressions, from constants to formal expressions containing
functions (built-in or user-defined, depending on space and time, etc),
arguments, discrete quantities and their associated differential
operators, etc. Note that `white space' (spaces, tabs, new line
characters) is ignored inside expressions.

Expressions are denoted by the metasyntactic variable @var{expression}
(remember the definition of the syntactic rules in @ref{Syntactic rules}):

@example
@var{expression}:
  @var{integer} |
  @var{real} |
  @var{constant-id} |
  @var{operator-unary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression} |
  @var{expression} ? @var{expression} : @var{expression} |
  @var{built-in-function-id} [ < @var{argument-list} > ] < @{ @var{parameter-list} @} > |
  @var{function-id} [ < @var{argument-list} > ] |
  @var{current-value} |
  @var{argument} |
  @var{discrete-quantity} 
@end example

@noindent The following sections introduce the quantities that can appear in
expressions, i.e.@: constant terminals (@var{integer}, @var{real}) and
constant expression identifiers (@var{constant-id}), operators

The three constant types used in GetDP are @var{integer}, @var{real} and
@var{string}.  These terminals have the same meaning and syntax as in
the C or C++ programming languages. Besides general expressions
(@var{expression}), purely constant expressions, denoted by the
metasyntactic variable @var{expression-cst}, are also used:

@example
@var{expression-cst}:
  @var{integer} |
  @var{real} |
  @var{constant-id} |
  @var{operator-unary} @var{expression-cst} |
  @var{expression-cst} @var{operator-binary} @var{expression-cst} |
  @var{math-function-id} [ < @var{expression-cst} <,@dots{}> > ]
@end example

Contrary to a general @var{expression} which is evaluated at runtime (thanks
to an internal stack mechanism), an @var{expressions-cst} is completely
evaluated during the syntactic analysis of the problem (when GetDP reads the
@file{.pro} file).  Definition of such constants or lists of constants with
identifiers can be done outside any GetDP object or inside @code{Group},
@code{Function} and @code{Constraint} objects. The syntax for the definition
of constants is the following:

@example
DefineConstant [ 
  @var{constant-id} < = @var{expression-cst} > <,@dots{}> 
]; |
@var{constant-id} = @var{expression-cst} | @var{expression-cst-list};
@end example

@noindent with

@example
@var{constant-id}:
  @var{string}

@var{expression-cst-list}:
  @{ @var{expression-cst} <,@dots{}> @} |
  ListAlt [ @var{constant-id} , @var{constant-id} ]
@end example

@noindent Notes:
@enumerate
@item
Five constants are predefined in GetDP: @code{Pi} (3.1415926535897932),
@code{0D} (0), @code{1D} (1), @code{2D} (2) and @code{3D} (3).
@item
The affectation in @code{DefineConstant} (zero if no
@var{expression-cst} is given) is performed only if @var{constant-id}
has not been defined yet. This kind of explicit default definition
mechanism is used several times in GetDP. It is most useful for use with
ready-to-use problem definition structures, which make use of a large
number of generic constants, functions or groups. When exploiting only a
part of a complex problem definition structure, the default definition
mechanism allows to only define the quantities of interest, the others
being assigned a default value (that will not be used during the
processing, but that avoids the error messages produced when references
to undefined quantities are made).
@item
@var{constant-id}'s of lists of constants (@var{expression-cst-list}) are
used for function parameters (@pxref{Functions}).
@item
The arguments of @code{ListAlt} must be @var{constant-id}'s of lists of
constants of the same dimension. The result is an alternate list of
these constants: first constant of argument 1, first constant of
argument 2, second constant of argument 1, @dots{}

Two types of functions coexist in GetDP: user-defined functions

(@var{built-in-function-id}, defined in this section). 

Both types of functions are always followed by a pair of brackets
@code{[]}, that can possibly contain arguments. This makes it simple to
distinguish a @var{function-id} or a @var{built-in-function-id} from a
@var{constant-id}. As shown below, built-in functions might also have
parameters, given between braces (@code{@{@}}):

Meshes (grids) constitute the input data of GetDP. All that is needed by
GetDP as a mesh is a file containing a list of nodes (with their
coordinates) and a list of geometrical elements with, for each one, a number
characterizing its geometrical type (i.e.@: line, triangle, quadrangle,
tetrahedron, hexahedron, prism, etc), a number characterizing the physical
region to which it belongs and the list of its nodes. This minimal input set
can be easily extracted from most of the classical mesh file
formats. @xref{Input file format}.

Groups of geometrical entities of various types can be considered and
are used in many objects. There are region groups, of which the entities
are regions, and function groups, with nodes, edges, facets, volumes,
groups of nodes, edges of tree, facets of tree, @dots{} of
regions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Amongst region groups, elementary and global groups can be
distinguished: elementary groups are relative to single regions (e.g.@:
physical regions in which piecewise defined functions or constraints can
be defined) while global groups are relative to sets of regions for
which given treatments have to be performed (e.g.@: domain of
integration, support of a function space, etc). 
@item
Groups of function type contain lists of entities built on some region
groups (e.g.@: nodes for nodal elements, edges for edge elements, edges
of tree for gauge conditions, groups of nodes for floating potentials,
elements on one side of a surface for cuts, etc).
@end itemize

A definition of initially empty groups can be done thanks to a
@code{DefineGroup} command, so that their identifiers exist and can be
referred to in other objects, even if these groups are not explicitly
defined. This procedure is similar to the procedure introduced for
constants in @ref{Constants} (cf. the note at the end of the section).

The syntax for the definition of groups is:

@example
Group @{
  < DefineGroup [ 
      @var{group-id} <@{@var{integer}@}> <,@dots{}> 
    ]; > @dots{}
  < @var{group-id} <@{<#>@var{integer}@}> = @var{group-def}; > @dots{}

A function can be global in space or piecewise defined in region
groups. A physical characteristic is an example of a piecewise defined
function (e.g.@: magnetic permeability, electric conductivity, etc) and
can be simply a constant, for linear materials, or a function of one or
several arguments for nonlinear materials. Such functions can of course
depend on space coordinates or time, which can be needed to express
complex constraints.

A definition of initially empty functions can be done so that their
identifiers exist and can be referred to (but cannot used) in other
objects. The syntax for the definition of functions is:

@example
Function @{
  < DefineFunction [

A @code{FunctionSpace} is characterized by the type of its interpolated
fields, one or several basis functions and optional constraints (in
space and time). Subspaces of a function space can be defined (e.g.@:
for the use with hierarchical elements), as well as direct associations of
global quantities (e.g.@: floating potential, electric charge, current,
voltage, magnetomotive force, etc).

A key point is that basis functions are defined by any number of subsets
of functions, being added. Each subset is characterized by associated
built-in functions for evaluation, a support of definition and a set of
associated supporting geometrical entities (e.g.@: nodes, edges, facets,
volumes, groups of nodes, edges incident to a node, etc). The freedom in
defining various kinds of basis functions associated with different
geometrical entities, to interpolate a field permits to build
made-to-measure function spaces adapted to a wide variety of field
approximations (@pxref{FunctionSpace examples}).

Jacobian methods can be referred to in @code{Formulation} and
@code{PostProcessing} objects to be used in the computation of integral
terms and for changes of coordinates. They are based on @code{Group}
objects and define the geometrical transformations applied to the
reference elements (i.e.@: lines, triangles, quadrangles, tetrahedra,
prisms, hexahedra, etc). Besides the classical lineic, surfacic and
volumic Jacobians, the @code{Jacobian} object allows the construction of
various transformation methods (e.g.@: infinite transformations for
unbounded domains) thanks to dedicated jabobian methods.

The syntax for the definition of Jacobian methods is:

@example
Jacobian @{

Various numerical or analytical integration methods can be referred to in

computation of integral terms, each with a set of particular options (number of
integration points for quadrature methods---which can be linked to an error
criterion for adaptative methods, definition of transformations for singular
integrations, etc). Moreover, the choice can be made between several
integration methods according to a criterion (e.g.@: on the proximity between
the source and computation points in integral formulations).

The @code{Formulation} tool permits to deal with volume, surface and
line integrals with many kinds of densities to integrate, written in a
form that is similar to their symbolic expressions (it uses the same
@var{expression} syntax as elsewhere in GetDP), which therefore permits
to take directly into account various kinds of elementary matrices
(e.g.@: with scalar or cross products, anisotropies, nonlinearities, time
derivatives, various test functions, etc). In case nonlinear physical
characteristics are considered, arguments are used for associated
functions. In that way, many formulations can be directly written in the
data file, as they are written symbolically. Fields involved in each
formulation are declared as belonging to beforehand defined function
spaces. The decoupling between formulations and function spaces allows
to maintain a generality in both their definitions.

A @code{Formulation} is characterized by its type, the involved
quantities (of local, global or integral type) and a list of equation
terms. Global equations can also be considered, e.g.@: for the coupling
with network relations.

The syntax for the definition of formulations is:

@example

@section Constant Expression Examples

The simplest constant expression consists of an @var{integer} or a
@var{real} number as in

@example
21
-3
@end example

@noindent or

@example
-3.1415
27e3
-290.53e-12
@end example

@noindent
Using operators and the classic math functions, @var{constant-id}'s can
be defined:

@example
c1 = Sin[2/3*3.1415] * 5000^2 ;
c2 = -1/c1 ;
@end example

@node Group examples, Function examples, Constant expression examples, Short examples
@section @code{Group} Examples

@cindex Group, examples

Let us assume that some elements in the input mesh are associated with the
region numbers 1000, 2000 and 3000. In the definitions

@example
Group @{
  Air = Region[1000]; Core = Region[2000]; Inductor = Region[3000];
  NonConductingDomain = Region[@{Air, Core@}];
  ConductingDomain    = Region[@{Inductor@}];
@}
@end example

@noindent
@code{Air}, @code{Core}, @code{Inductor} are identifiers of elementary
region groups while @code{NonConductingDom@-ain} and
@code{ConductingDomain} are global region groups.

Groups of function type contain lists of entities built on the region groups 
appearing in their arguments. For example,

@example
NodesOf[NonConductingDomain]
@end example

@noindent
represents the group of nodes of geometrical elements belonging to the regions 
in @code{NonConduc@-tingDomain} and 

@example
EdgesOf[DomainC, Not SkinDomainC]
@end example

@noindent
represents the group of edges of geometrical elements belonging to the regions 
in @code{DomainC} but not to those of @code{SkinDomainC}.

@c Function Examples
@c -------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Function examples, Constraint examples, Group examples, Short examples
@section @code{Function} Examples

@cindex Function, examples

A physical characteristic is a piecewise defined function. The magnetic
permeability @code{mu[]} can for example be defined in the considered
regions by

@example
Function @{
  mu[Air] = 4.e-7*Pi; 
  mu[Core] = 1000.*4.e-7*Pi;
@}
@end example

@noindent
A nonlinear characteristic can be defined through an @var{expression} 
with arguments, e.g.

@example
Function @{
  mu0 = 4.e-7*Pi;
  a1 = 1000.; b1 = 100.; // Constants
  mu[NonlinearCore] = mu0 + 1./(a1+b1*Norm[$1]^6);
@}
@end example

@noindent
where function @code{mu[]} in region @code{NonLinearCore} has one argument 
@code{$1} which has to be the magnetic flux density @var{b} = curl @var{a}. 
This function is actually called when writing the equations of a formulation, 
which enables to directly extend it to a nonlinear form by adding only the 
necessary arguments, e.g.@: by writing @code{nu[@{Curl a@}]} instead of 
@code{nu[]} in @code{Equation} terms (@pxref{Formulation examples}).

A function can also be time dependent, e.g.

@example
Function @{
  Freq = 50.; Phase = 30./180.*Pi; // Constants
  TimeFct_Sin[] = Sin [ 2.*Pi*Freq * $Time + Phase ];
  TimeFct_Exp[] = Exp [ - $Time / 0.0119 ];
  TimeFct_ExtSin[] = F_Sin_wt_p [] @{2.*Pi*Freq, Phase@};
@}
@end example

@noindent
Note that @code{TimeFct_ExtSin[]} is an extended math function equivalent to
@code{TimeFct_Sin[]}.  It is usually used in harmonic analyses for implicit
definitions of phasors.

@node Constraint examples, FunctionSpace examples, Function examples, Short examples
@section @code{Constraint} Examples

@cindex Constraint, examples

Constraints are referred to in @code{FunctionSpace}'s and are usually used 
for boundary conditions (@code{Assign} type). 
For example, essential conditions on two surface regions, 
@code{Surf0} and @code{Surf1}, will be first defined by

@example
Constraint @{
  @{ Name DirichletBoundaryCondition1; Type Assign;
    Case @{
      @{ Region Surf0; Value 0.; @}
      @{ Region Surf1; Value 1.; @}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
The way the @code{Value}'s are associated with @code{Region}'s (with their nodes,
their edges, their global regions, @dots{}) is defined in the 
@code{FunctionSpace}'s which use the @code{Constraint}.
In other words, a @code{Constraint} defines data but does not define the method
to process them.

Other constraints can be referred to in @code{Formulation}'s. It is the case of 
those defining electrical circuits connections (@code{Network} type), e.g.@:

@example
Constraint @{
  @{ Name ElectricalCircuit; Type Network; 
    Case Circuit1 @{
      @{ Region VoltageSource; Branch @{1,2@}; @}
      @{ Region PrimaryCoil; Branch @{1,2@}; @}
    @}
    Case Circuit2 @{
      @{ Region SecondaryCoil; Branch @{1,2@}; @}
      @{ Region Charge; Branch @{1,2@}; @}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
which defines two non-connected circuits (@code{Circuit1} and @code{Circuit2}),
with independent numbering of nodes: region @code{VoltageSource} is connected in
parallel with region @code{PrimaryCoil}, and region @code{SecondaryCoil} is 
connected in parallel with region @code{Charge}.

@node Conform space, High order space, FunctionSpace examples, FunctionSpace examples
@subsection Nodal Finite Element Spaces

The most elementary function space is the nodal finite element space, 
defined on a mesh of a domain @var{W} and denoted @i{S0(W)} 
(associated finite elements can be of various geometries), 
and associated with essential boundary conditions (Dirichlet conditions). 
It contains 0-forms, i.e.@: scalar fields of potential type:

@tex
$$ v = \sum_{n\in N} v_n s_n \quad v\in S^0(W) $$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@var{v} = Sum [ @var{vn} * @var{sn} ,  for all @var{n} in @var{N} ] ,  
@var{v} in @i{S0(W)}
@end ifnottex

@noindent
where @var{N} is the set of nodes of @var{W}, @var{sn} is the nodal basis function 
associated with node @var{n} and @var{vn} is the value of @var{v} at node @var{n}. 
It is defined by

@example
FunctionSpace @{
  @{ Name Hgrad_v; Type Form0;
    BasisFunction @{
      @{ Name sn; NameOfCoef vn; Function BF_Node;
        Support Domain; Entity NodesOf[All]; @}
    @}
    Constraint @{
      @{ NameOfCoef vn; EntityType NodesOf;
        NameOfConstraint DirichletBoundaryCondition1; @}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
Function @code{sn} is the built-in basis function BF_Node associated with 
all nodes (@code{NodesOf}) in the mesh of @var{W} (@code{Domain}). Previously 
defined @code{Constraint DirichletBoundaryCondition1} 
(@pxref{Constraint examples}) is used as boundary conditions. 

In the example above, @code{Entity NodesOf[All]} is preferred to 
@code{Entity NodesOf[Domain]}. 
In this way, the list of all the nodes of @code{Domain} will not have to be 
generated. All the nodes of each geometrical element in @code{Support Domain}
will be directly taken into account.

@c High Order Nodal Finite Element Space
@c .........................................................................

@node High order space, Global values, Conform space, FunctionSpace examples
@subsection High Order Nodal Finite Element Space

Higher order finite elements can be directly taken into account by @code{BF_Node}. 
Hierarchical finite elements for 0-forms can be used by simply adding other basis 
functions (associated with other geometrical entities, e.g.@: edges and facets) to 
@code{BasisFunction}, e.g.@:

@example
    @dots{}
    BasisFunction @{
      @{ Name sn; NameOfCoef vn; Function BF_Node;
        Support Domain; Entity NodesOf[All]; @}
      @{ Name s2; NameOfCoef v2; Function BF_Node_2E;

@subsection Nodal Finite Element Space with Floating Potentials

A scalar potential with floating values @var{vf} on certain boundaries @var{Gf}, 
@var{f} in @var{Cf}, e.g.@: for electrostatic problems, can be expressed as

@tex
$$ v = \sum_{n\in N_v} v_n s_n + \sum_{f\in C_f} v_f s_f    \quad v\in S^0(W)  $$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@var{v} = Sum [ @var{vn} * @var{sn} ,  for all @var{n} in @var{Nv} ] + Sum [ @var{vf} * @var{sf} ,  for all @var{f} in @var{Cf} ] ,
@var{v} in @i{S0(W)}
@end ifnottex

@noindent
where @var{Nv} is the set of inner nodes of @var{W} and each function @var{sf} 
is associated with the group of nodes of boundary @var{Gf}, @var{f} in @var{Cf} 
(@code{SkinDomainC}); @var{sf} is the sum of the nodal basis functions 
of all the nodes of @var{Cf}. Its function space is defined by

@example
FunctionSpace @{
  @{ Name Hgrad_v_floating; Type Form0;
    BasisFunction @{
      @{ Name sn; NameOfCoef vn; Function BF_Node;
        Support Domain; Entity NodesOf[All, Not SkinDomainC]; @}

      @{ Name GlobalElectricCharge; Type AssociatedWith; 
        NameOfCoef vf; @}
    @}
    Constraint @{ @dots{} @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
Two global quantities have been associated with this space: the electric
potential @code{Global@-ElectricPotential}, being an alias of
coefficient @code{vf}, and the electric charge
@code{GlobalElec@-tricCharge}, being associated with coefficient
@code{vf}.

Another space is the edge finite element space, denoted @i{S1(W)}, 
containing 1-forms, i.e.@: curl-conform fields:

@tex
$$ {\bf h} = \sum_{e\in E} h_e {\bf s}_e   \quad{\bf h}\in S^1(W)  $$
@end tex

@noindent
where @var{E} is the set of edges of @var{W}, @var{se} is the edge basis 
function for edge @var{e} and @var{he} is the circulation of @var{h} along 
edge @var{e}. It is defined by

@example

@node Gauge condition, Coupled spaces, Curl-conform space, FunctionSpace examples
@subsection Edge Finite Element Space with Gauge Condition

A 1-form function space containing vector potentials can be associated
with a gauge condition, which can be defined as a constraint, e.g.@: a
zero value is fixed for all circulations along edges of a tree
(@code{EdgesOfTreeIn}) built in the mesh (@code{Domain}), having to be
complete on certain boundaries (@code{StartingOn Surf}):

@example
Constraint @{
  @{ Name GaugeCondition_a_Mag_3D; Type Assign;
    Case @{
      @{ Region Domain; SubRegion Surf; Value 0.; @}
    @}
  @}
@}

FunctionSpace @{

        NameOfConstraint GaugeCondition_a_Mag_3D; @}
      @dots{}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
The same gauge could also be defined in the BasisFunction field itself, by 
limiting the set of entities supporting the unknowns: 
@code{Entity EdgesOf[All]} would then be replaced by 
@code{Entity EdgesOfTreeIn[Domain, StartingOn Surf]}.

(@code{DomainCC}) of @var{W}, which are the complementary part of @var{Wc} 
(@code{DomainC}) in @var{W}, can be explicitly characterized by


@tex

@var{h} in @i{S1(W)}
@end ifnottex

@noindent
where @var{Ec} is the set of inner edges of @var{W}, @var{NcC} is the set of 
nodes inside @var{WcC} and on its boundary @var{dWcC}, @var{sk} is an edge 
basis function and @var{vn} is a vector nodal function. Such a space, coupling 
a vector field with a scalar potential, can be defined by

@example

function @code{vn} being defined with @code{BF_GradNode} in @code{DomainCC} and

@subsection Electrostatic Scalar Potential Formulation

@cindex Electrostatic formulation
@cindex Formulation, electrostatics
@cindex Nodal function space, example

An electrostatic formulation using an electric scalar potential @var{v}, i.e.

@tex
$$ (\epsilon\,{\rm grad}\,v, {\rm grad}\,v')_W = 0 \quad\forall v'\in S^0(W)  $$
@end tex
@ifnottex
( epsr grad @var{v} , grad @var{vp} ) @var{W} = 0 ,  for all @var{vp} in @i{S0(W)} ,
@end ifnottex

@noindent
is expressed by

@example
Formulation @{
  @{ Name Electrostatics_v; Type FemEquation;
    Quantity @{
      @{ Name v; Type Local; NameOfSpace Hgrad_v; @}
    @}
    Equation @{ 
      Galerkin @{ [ epsr[] * Dof@{Grad v@} , @{Grad v@} ];
                 In Domain; Jacobian Vol; Integration Int_1; @}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
The density of the @code{Galerkin} term is a copy of the symbolic form of 
the formulation: product of a relative permittivity function @code{epsr[]} 
with a vector of degrees of freedom (@code{Dof@{.@}}); 
the scalar product of this with the gradient of test function 
@code{v} results in a symmetrical matrix.

@noindent
Note that another @code{Quantity} could be defined for test functions, e.g.@:
@code{vp} defined by @code{@{ Name vp; Type Local; NameOfSpace Hgrad_v; @}}.
Nevertheless, its use would result in the computation of a full matrix and
consequently in a loss of efficiency.

one half of the structure is considered by symmetry.

@cindex Running GetDP

GetDP has no graphical interface. It is a command-line driven program that
reads a problem definition file once at the begining of the processing. This
problem definition file is a regular ASCII file (@pxref{Numerical tools as
objects}), hence created with whatever editor you like.

If you just type the program name at your shell prompt (without any
argument), you will get a short help on how to run GetDP. All GetDP
calls look like

@example
getdp @var{filename} @var{options} 
@end example

@noindent
where @var{filename} is an ASCII file containing the problem definition,
i.e.@: the structures this user's guide taught you to create. This file
can include other files (@pxref{Includes}), so that only one problem
definition file should always be given on the command line. The input
files containing the problem definition structure are usually given the
@file{.pro} extension (if so, there is no need to specify the extension
on the command line). The name of this file (without the extension) is
used as a basis for the creation of intermediate files during the
pre-processing and the processing stages.

The @var{options} are a combination of the following commands (in any
order):

@table @code
@item -pre @var{resolution-id}
@cindex @code{-pre}
Performs the pre-processing associated with the resolution
@var{resolution-id}. In the pre-processing stage, GetDP creates the
geometric database (from the mesh file), identifies the degrees of
freedom (the unknowns) of the problem and sets up the constraints on
these degrees of freedom. The pre-processing creates a file with a
@file{.pre} extension. If @var{resolution-id} is omitted, the list of
available choices is displayed.

@item -cal
@cindex @code{-cal}
Performs the processing. This requires that a pre-processing has been
performed previously, or a that a @code{-pre} option is given on the
same command line. The performed resolution is the one given as an
argument to the @code{-pre} option. In the processing stage, GetDP
executes all the commands given in the @code{Operation} field of the
selected @code{Resolution} object (such as matrix assemblies, system
resolutions, ...).

@item -pos @var{post-operation-id} @dots{}
@cindex @code{-pos}
Performs the operations in the @var{PostOperation}(s) selected by the
@var{post-operation-id}(s). This requires that a processing has been
performed previously, or that a @code{-cal} option is given on the same
command line. If @var{post-operation-id} is omitted, the list of available
choices is displayed.

@item -ipos @var{post-processing-id} @dots{}
@cindex @code{-ipos}
Enters an interactive post-processing mode, enabling to enter
@code{PostOperation}-like commands manually. These commands are based on the
@var{PostProcessing} object(s) selected by the @var{post-processing-id}(s).
If @var{post-processing-id} is omitted, the list of available choices is
displayed.

@item -msh @var{filename}
@cindex @code{-msh}
Reads the mesh database (in @code{.msh} format) from @var{filename}
(@pxref{File formats}) instead of in the default problem file name (with
the @file{.msh} extension appended).

@item -split
@cindex @code{-split}
save processing results in separate files (one for each timestep).

@item -res @var{filename} @dots{}
@cindex @code{-res}
load processing results from file(s).

@item -restart
@cindex @code{-restart}
Restarts processing of a transient problem interrupted before being complete.

@item -solve @var{resolution-id}
@cindex @code{-solve}
Same as @code{-pre @var{resolution-id} -cal}.

@item -adapt @var{file}
@cindex @code{-adapt}
Reads adaption constraints from file.

@item -order @var{real}
@cindex @code{-order}
Specifies the maximum interpolation order.

@item -bin 
@cindex @code{-bin}
Selects binary format for output files.

@item -log
@cindex @code{-log}
Saves all processing history in a log file (the input file name with an
appended @code{.log} extension).

@item -check  
@cindex @code{-check}
Lets you check the problem structure interactively. 

@item -v @var{int}
@cindex @code{-v}
Sets the verbosity level. A value of 0 means that no information will be
displayed during processing.

@item -p @var{int}
@cindex @code{-p}
Sets the progress update rate. This controls the refreshment rate of the
counter indicating the progress of the current computation.

@item -info
@cindex @code{-info}
Displays version information.

@item -version
@cindex @code{-version}
Displays version number.

@item -help
@cindex @code{-help}
Displays a message listing basic usage and available options.

The @file{.pre} file is generated by the pre-processing stage. It
contains all the information about the degrees of freedom to be
considered during the processing stage for a given resolution (i.e.@:
unknowns, fixed values, initial values, etc).

@example
$Resolution /* '@var{resolution-id}' */
@var{main-resolution-number} @var{number-of-dofdata}
$EndResolution
$DofData /* #@var{dofdata-number} */
@var{resolution-number} @var{system-number}

  @var{equation-number} @var{dof-value}
    (@var{dof-type}: 5; @var{initial value for an unknown})

@end example


@noindent Notes:
@enumerate
@item
There is one @code{$DofData} field for each system of equations considered in 
the resolution (including those considered in pre-resolutions).
@item
The @var{dofdata-number} of a @code{$DofData} field is determined by the order 
of this field in the @file{.pre} file.
@item
@var{number-of-dof} is the dimension of the considered system of equations, while 
@var{number-of-any-dof} is the total number of degrees of freedom before 
the application of constraints.
@item
Each degree of freedom is coded with three integer values, which are the 
associated basis function, entity and harmonic numbers, i.e.@:
@var{dof-basis-function-number}, @var{dof-entity} and @var{dof-harmonic}.

The @file{.res} file is generated by the processing stage. It contains
the solution of the problem (or a part of it in case of program
interruption).

@example
$ResFormat /* GetDP v@var{getdp-version-number}, @var{string-for-format} */

@noindent Notes:
@enumerate
@item
A @code{$Solution} field contains the solution associated with a 
@code{$DofData} field.
@item
There is one @code{$Solution} field for each time step, of which the time is 
@var{time-value} (0 for non time dependent analyses).
@item
The order of the @var{solution-value}'s in a @code{$Solution} field follows 
the numbering of the equations given in the @file{.pre} file 
(one floating point value for each degree of freedom).

@c The analysis of the syntax is performed by Lex and Yacc, the software
@c being written in C. C permits the manipulation of data structures and
@c function pointers in ways that Fortran simply does not allow. ANSI C is
@c a complete standard that all modern C compilers support, and the
@c language is identical on all machines. It would be natural and
@c reasonable to have coded GetDP in C++; we have opted to use C instead,
@c since C++ is still evolving and compilers on different machines still
@c present differences on advanced features. Using C function pointers to
@c provide data encapsulation and polymorphism has allowed us to get many
@c of the advantages of C++ without using such a large and more complicated
@c language.

If you think you have found a bug in GetDP, you can report it by
electronic mail to @email{Patrick.Dular@@ulg.ac.be} or
@email{Christophe.Geuzaine@@ulg.ac.be}.  Please send as precise a description
of the problem as you can, including sample input files that produce the
bug (problem definition and mesh files). Don't forget to mention both
the versions of GetDP and of your operation system (@pxref{Running
GetDP} to see how to get this information).

Here is a list of known bugs:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Install the 'info' version of this user's guide! On your (Unix) system, this
can be done by 1) copying all getdp.info* files to the place where your info
files live (usually /usr/info), and 2) issuing the command 'install-info
/usr/info/getdp.info /usr/info/dir'. You will then be able to access the
documentation with the command 'info getdp'. Note that particular sections
("nodes") can be accessed directly. For example, 'info getdp functionspace'
will take you directly to the definition of the FunctionSpace object.
@item
Use emacs to edit your files, and load the C++ mode! This permits automatic
syntax highlighting and easy indentation. Automatic loading of the C++ mode
for @file{.pro} files can be done by adding the following command in your
@code{.emacs} file: @code{(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.pro$"
. c++-mode)) auto-mode-alist))}.
@item
Define integration and Jacobian method in separate files, reusable in all
your problem definition structures (@pxref{Includes}). Define meshes,
groups, functions and constraints in one file dependent of the geometrical
model, and functions spaces, formulations, resolutions and post-processings
in files independent of the geometrical model.
@item
Use @code{All} as soon as you can in the definition of topological
entities used as @code{Entity} of @code{BasisFunction}'s. 
This will prevent GetDP of constructing unnecessary lists of entities.
@item
Intentionnally misspelling an object type in the problem definition
structure will produce an error message listing all available types in
the particular context.
@item
If you don't specify the mandatory arguments on the command line, GetDP will
give you the available choices. For example, 'getdp test -pos' (the name of
the PostOperation is missing) will produce an error message listing all
available PostOperations.

Gmsh is a three-dimensional meshing tool (with pre- and post-processing
facilities). Written in C/C++ and using OpenGL, Gmsh is available for
most of the classical UNIX platforms (SUN, DEC, IBM, HP and Linux) and
for Windows 95/98/NT. Gmsh can be downloaded from @value{WEB-GMSH}.

This appendix reproduces verbatim the input files needed by Gmsh to
produce the mesh files @file{mStrip.msh} and @file{Core.msh} used in the
examples of @ref{Complete examples}.
