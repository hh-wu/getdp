New in 2.0.0: general code cleanup (separated interface from legacy
code; removed various undocumented, unstable and otherwise
experimental features; moved to C++); updated input file formats;
default solvers are now based on PETSc; small bug fixes (binary .res
read, Newmark -restart).

New in 1.2: Windows versions do not depend on Cygwin anymore; major
parser cleanup (loops & co).

New in 1.1: New eigensolver based on Arpack (EigenSolve); generalized
old Lanczos solver to work with GSL+lapack; reworked PETSc interface,
which now requires PETSc 2.3; documented many previously undocumented
features (loops, conditionals, strings, link constraints, etc.);
various improvements and bug fixes.

New in 1.0: New license (GNU GPL); added support for latest Gmsh mesh
file format; more code cleanups.

New in 0.91: Merged moving band and multi-harmonic code; new loops and
conditionals in the parser; removed old readline code (just use GNU
readline if available); upgraded to latest Gmsh post-processing
format; various small enhancements and bug fixes.

New in 0.89: Code cleanup.

New in 0.88: Integrated FMM code.

New in 0.87: Fixed major performance problem on Windows (matrix
assembly and post-processing can be up to 3-4 times faster with 0.87
compared to 0.86, bringing performance much closer to Unix versions);
fixed stack overflow on Mac OS X; Re-introduced face basis functions
mistakenly removed in 0.86; fixed post-processing bug with pyramidal
basis functions; new build system based on autoconf.

New in 0.86: Updated Gmsh output format; many small bug fixes.

New in 0.85: Upgraded communication interface with Gmsh; new
ChangeOfValues option in PostOperation; many internal changes.

New in 0.84: New ChangeOfCoordinate option in PostOperation; fixed
crash in InterpolationAkima; improved interactive postprocessing
(-ipos); changed syntax of parametric OnGrid ($S, $T -> $A, $B, $C);
corrected Skin for non simplicial meshes; fixed floating point
exception in diagonal matrix scaling; many other small fixes and
cleanups.

New in 0.83: Fixed bugs in SaveSolutions[] and InitSolution[]; fixed
corrupted binary post-processing files in the harmonic case for the
Gmsh format; output files are now created relatively to the input file
directory; made solver options available on the command line; added
optional matrix scaling and changed default parameter file name to
'solver.par' (Warning: please check the scaling definition in your old
SOLVER.PAR files); generalized syntax for lists (start:[incr]end ->
start:end:incr); updated reference guide; added a new short
presentation on the web site; OnCut -> OnSection; new functional
syntax for resolution operations (e.g. Generate X -> Generate[X]);
many other small fixes and cleanups.

New in 0.82: Added communication socket for interactive use with Gmsh;
corrected (again) memory problem (leak + seg. fault) in time stepping
schemes; corrected bug in Update[].

New in 0.81: Generalization of transformation jacobians (spherical and
rectangular, with optional parameters); changed handling of missing
command line arguments; enhanced Print OnCut; fixed memory leak for
time domain analysis of coupled problems; -name option; fixed
seg. fault in ILUK.

New in 0.80: Fixed computation of time derivatives on first time step
(in post-processing); added tolerance in transformation jacobians;
fixed parsing of DOS files (carriage return problems); automatic
memory reallocation in ILUD/ILUK.

New in 0.79: Various bug fixes (mainly for the post-processing of
intergal quantities); automatic treatment of degenerated cases in
axisymmetrical problems.

New in 0.78: Various bug fixes.

New in 0.77: Changed syntax for PostOperations (Plot suppressed in
favour of Print; Plot OnRegion becomes Print OnElementsOf); changed
table oriented post-processing formats; new binary formats; new error
diagnostics.

New in 0.76: Reorganized high order shape functions; optimization of
the post-processing (faster and less bloated); lots of internal
cleanups.

New in 0.74: High order shape functions; lots of small bug fixes.

New in 0.73: Eigen value problems (Lanczos); minor corrections.

New in 0.7: constraint syntax; fourier transform; unary minus
correction; complex integral quantity correction; separate iteration
matrix generation.

New in 0.6: Second order time derivatives; Newton nonlinear scheme;
Newmark time stepping scheme; global quantity syntax; interactive
post-processing; tensors; integral quantities; post-processing
facilities.

New in 0.3: First distributed version.
